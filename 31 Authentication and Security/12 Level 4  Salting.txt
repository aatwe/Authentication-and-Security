How to prevent hash table cracks attacks/ dictionary attacks


SALTING
What is salting?
				hashfn
password + random set of characters --------> HASH
		//unique salt


For ex
PW	Salt			Hash
qwerty	67hgdhj89HDG		457sdfsdfs78976876s9df

For similar passwords also -> hash will be different because different salt is different

Where is salt? stored in DB, User need not remember

But GPU Speed: 20Billion Hashes/Second
Solution? BCrypt Hashing algorithm
