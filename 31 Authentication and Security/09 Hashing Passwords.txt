What is hashing? 
					    cipher method = AES/Caeser etc
What was encryption: take user password + secure key ====> 		Ciphered text
//encrypt		for ex	   qwerty      +	1        = caeser=		rvfsuz
//decrypt			    qwerty 	          = caeser= 	  -1 + 	rvfsuz

How to make password more secure?
What we using rn? encryption key
encryption key can be cracked



hashing? takes away need for key
What is hash function? equations designed 
				password------> hash	//easy	(1ms taken)
			to make  password <---- hash  	//impossible (2 years taken)
					
1) Hash function turns password into a hash
2) hash stored in database
3) Ex of equation/hash function to solve
	what factos of 377 except 1 and 377?	//going back is very difficult
	Ans 13, 29
	What is 13x29 ==> 377	//v easy 
4) hash function always converts to same hash

How applicable to login?
1) User enter password
2) password turn to hash
3) match hash with hash stored
