Authentication
1) We created password
2) encrypted DB
3) hashed PW
-------General Website security level reached------------

 
Arent big companies hasing their pw? yes they are
why hacked?

ex
1) hacker gets in DB
2) 3 different string have same hash. Why?
3) hacker realises
4) hacker constructs hash table
	takes most common password -> their hash values in table
	PW		Hash
	123456		asfdjhkajdshflajkh
	qwerty		`aueoiuaopifuoiuash
	password		nrjlejnrlqkwjernl
	111111		uoiupaudpfowie


	Then compare these hash with hash in table 	(i.e search by the hash value)

5) hacker finds qwerty hash value in db

6) Create hash for all words from dictionary (1.5 lac

7)	All number in phone boook		(50lac)

8)	All combo of characters upto 6	(19000 crore  )

			-> Total 19.8 Billion combinations

9) Hacker buys latest GPU/graphic cards (parallel processing capable)
				(used for bitocoin mining + generating hashes)

	Using latest GPU -> can calculate 20 Billion MD5 Hashes / second
	Takes 0.9 seconds for GPU to match all hash values 
	Hackers build large hashtables for most common passwords
	MD5 is quickest hash to calculate
	V common to find MD5 hash tables


WHAT SOLUTION? 
one hash that was very difficult to find
Cannot even google that

LONG PASSWORD HELPS (time to solve increases exponentially with length)
DONT USE DICTIONARY WORD
OR PLACENAME
OR something that is in a DIRECTORY

for ex PW length: 6 ---> desktop can crack in 3 seconds, fast pc 1 second
	           12 ---->	                          31 years , fast pc 8 years, GPU 3 years, Fast GPU 2 years, parallelGPU 2 month, medium botnet 16 minute
