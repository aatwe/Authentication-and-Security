3rd Party Login
 OAtuh
What is OAuth? Open standard for token based Authorization

Objective: new user on bracebook -> no friends
	Check his fb friends who are on bracebook
	recommend them

	GET
FB	<-----		BB


1) BB makes GET Request to Facebook asking for user friend table
2) FB sends POST request user friend table to bracebook with list users and emails
3) find matching users from that table

For ex linkeidn finds contact from gmail 

How to do this? OAuth


Big tech: Keeps our passwords secure (Good Engineers )
so delegate them the task of authenticating

Log on FB -> FB will authenticate securely -> FB verifies and sends back permission to authenticate

1) Why OAuth? 
		A) Alllows granular level access
			Granular = developer can request what data he needs
			How granular? if making x website -> need only email + profile
				         if making tinder       -> need friends + email + profile
		B) Read/Read + Write Access
			Read access = read data from fb
`			write access = write data to facebook on behalf of y website

		C) FB(3rd party) user can revoke access from FB itself

2) How OAuth works
	A) Setup your app 
		Tell 3rd party about our webapp
		How to tell?
		Set up App in 3rd party developer console, Become client
	`	Get app id / client id
		
	B) Redirect to 3rd party to Authenticate
		take to actual website to login		(How to make others trust? take to genuine reference )
		User logins
	C) User Grants permissions requested by website	
		ex profile + email

	D) third party sends Authorization OR access token code to our website
				Authorization : One Time	//just for authentication
				Access token : : Valid longer 	//granular access to information
		User sign in at 3rd party verified on our website
